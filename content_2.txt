### **Solution**

We propose a series of events, of which each stage is functioning as a funnel, aiming to maximize successful interactions between DataStax and the community. Utilizing advanced predictive analytics, we will identify and facilitate high-potential connections with the goal of finding non-zero sum optimum. This targeted approach is designed to guide decision-making and enhance the value of each interaction, ensuring DataStax's participation translates into tangible outcomes.

### How it works

We start by learning more about DataStaxâ€™s goals and objectives. For example purposes we assume their goals to be:

- **Expanding Market Reach**
- **Fostering Talent and Innovation**

With these goals in mind we defined four ***attendee types for the first event.***

1. **Individuals:** Technical individuals looking to deepen their knowledge and broaden their network (e.g., startup founders, tech professionals, students, corporate workers).
2. **Businesses:** Companies and organizations looking to integrate GenAI solutions into their workflow (e.g., Booking.com, Bol.com, Financial institutions, Government).
3. **Suppliers:** Companies offering products in the GenAI ecosystem (e.g., DataStax, HuggingFace, AWS, Google).
4. **Facilitators:** Companies with the expertise to integrate complex tech solutions into business operations (e.g., Deloitte, Incubators).

![Fig 1. Example of attendee distribution.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1507ad8f-8702-49c6-81f7-6432c61e5ee6/49dd87c8-41cd-4b9e-8a06-df708431ec2b/Untitled.png)

Fig 1. Example of attendee distribution.

### **Pre-event**

**Step 1:** Consult with ***Supplier Attendees*** to define their problems and objectives. This would result in a comprehensive description of the form, content, and technical level of post-event workshops on the topics. of building RAG pipelines with LLMs.

Another problem description might be HR-related, for which we could define desired employee personas and map what the company offers them.

**Step 2:** Analyze the problems of ***Supplier Attendees*** and define a benchmark for the relative distribution of Individuals and Business representatives subgroups. We will invite targeted individuals from our extensive network of AI professionals, academics, and government organizations to the AI Innovators Summit.

**Step 3:** Onboard ***Individual and Business Attendees*** to define their problems, objectives, preferences, motivations, strengths, and constraints using an LLM-powered chatbot.

**Conversational Flow**

- At the start, ***Individual and Business Attendees*** will receive a transparent, human-readable outline of our data privacy policy.
- The chatbot engages in conversation to gather relevant information.
- The chatbot concludes with a time-constrained assessment, where the user attempts to prompt-hack the LLM and find system vulnerabilities.
- The chat history is processed into a standardized format using Instructor GPT and Pydantic.
- The user will be granted admission based on AI analysis, with a human making the final decision.
- Users granted admission will receive an invite, and a copy of the data we have stored on them. They are again informed about our data policy and given the opportunity to edit or delete their data. The data of users not granted access will not be stored.

**Step 4:** The user data is converted into an attendee profile. Missing information is added by an custom build [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) powered research application.

For example: An attendee provides information about their goals for the event, technical proficiency, GenAI experience, and position in their company. Publicly available information could include company details, industry specifics, dominant competitors, data on industry GenAI adoption, and current company projects involving GenAI.

**Step 5:** Consult with ***Facilitator Attendees*** to understand their moat. Facilitators are granted access to the event if they have relevant expertise to help companies with the adoption of GenAI and Vector Search into their workflow. Facilitators can represent established names like Deloitte, but could also be AI consultancy startups or freelancers.

### **During the Event**

**Step 6:** ***Supplier Attendees*** receive a list of ***Builder Attendee*** profiles ranked based on potential mutual benefit.

**Step 7:** 

Upon arrival, each visitor is equipped with a name badge containing a NFC chip, facilitating seamless information exchange via smartphone. The badge links to a dynamic profile URL, which is much more than a static digital business card. It's a live, evolving document powered by a Multi-Agent AutoGen AI (MA), intelligently crafted from the data gathered from each attendee's profile through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

This innovative approach personalizes networking experiences. Attendees view each other's information 'through the eye of the beholder', meaning they access only the most relevant details about others, tailored to their shared goals and interests. The MA applies principles of Game Theory to analyze and determine the optimal mutual benefits, crafting personalized conversation starters. This not only breaks the ice but also ensures that each interaction is purposeful, aligned with the attendees' objectives, and rich with potential for meaningful connections.

**Step 8:** The audience is provided a dynamic mix of informative, novel, and practical content delivered by prominent representatives of various ***Supplier Attendees*** and Industry Thought Leaders. Between talks, our Host invites the audience to engage in brainstorm sessions and assessments using collaborative software.

The outcomes of these live sessions are processed in real-time and used to update the respective high-potential list of each ***Supplier Attendee**.*

**Step 9**: After the informative and collaborative parts of the event, each attendee is equipped with a potential treasure of tailored data about relevant others in the room. While enjoying music, great food, cocktails, and craft beers, they are free to do what humans do best: socialize, augmented with AI to make every handshake count (and to count every handshake).

### **Post-event**

**Step 10:** ***Supplier Attendees*** follow up with the valuable connections they made.

**Step 11:** Step into Liquid conducts post-event interviews with a number of attendees and presents their findings tailored to each ***Supplier Attendee.***
